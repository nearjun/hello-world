# hello-world
Hi,my name is Neal. 
For the last 10 years, I worked 5 years to find out my interests, my talents and to promote my professional experience, I have done several jobs including salesman, chemist and started a company. During this process, I met an angel, which is my wife. She is patient and gave me lots of ideas. Now I have found my real passion, which is Computer Science, I am good at using tools and excited to face challenges and solve problems. Thank you again for giving me this opportunity.
